# Leonardo Falabella

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Government at LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government) and hold a PhD from the [University of California, San Diego](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/). My research investigates the role of cultural values in vote choice.

I have developed supplemental resources for teaching data literacy, conducted research in pedagogy (R&R, Plos One), and designed active learning strategies for every session of my course offering on data analytics. My student evaluations are available for download.

While at UCSD, I was awarded the [Barbara and Paul Saltman Excellent Teaching Award](https://senate.ucsd.edu/grants-awards/senate-awards/distinguished-teaching-award), a prestigious university-wide award bestowed upon three graduate students per year. I have also received the [Class Teacher Award](https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/education/Education-awards/LSE-Class-Teacher-Awards) at LSE.
